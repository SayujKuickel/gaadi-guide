## Welcome

Welcome to the Kathmandu Bus Routes project! This application aims to provide a clear and interactive map of various bus routes across Kathmandu, Nepal. I am building this app to solve the lack of centralized, easily accessible route information.

This project is being actively developed and you can see the full feature list i will be adding in the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/2002054224e68038b8f1dd5e64f0a636?v=2002054224e681548951000c5b4845fc).
