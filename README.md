# Welcome!

Welcome to the Gaadi Guide project! This application aims to provide a clear and interactive map of various bus routes across Kathmandu, Nepal. I am building this app to solve the lack of centralized, easily accessible route information.

This project is being actively developed and you can see the full feature list I plan to add in the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/2002054224e68038b8f1dd5e64f0a636?v=2002054224e681548951000c5b4845fc).

Check out the demo [here](https://gaadiguide.sayuj.com.np/).
